# React Mortgage Calculator
This app is a simple mortgage payment calculator app using React and Bootstrap for styling.

## Challenges
I will be the first to admit that math has never been my strong suit. I always had to work harder that most people in my classes growing up to understand concepts, and would end up testing pretty well and coming out with good grades. Although this app didn't have much math, it did have enough to throw me for a loop and stall me for a little bit. 

## Wins
I ended up really enjoying the process for this app, including the math side of it. This app provided a good challenge for me and was a great way to learn about state in React.
